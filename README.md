### Disclamer: $BUIDL V1 will not be supported by the DFOhub team after 1st August 2020.
### Disclamer: Switching $BUIDL V1 to $buidl V2 is an irreversible action. Do it at your own risk.

# FAQ

## Does buidl V1 still have a function? 
Nope. The only action you can do with buidl V1 now is switch it to buidl V2.
## Is buidl V2 a fork? 
Nope. DFOhub only has only one governance token, and that is buidl V2. This token change was a necessary update to add some security features (Detailed info in the last weekly) and was an important experiment on the last untested flexibility mechanism of the DFO protocol (changing the voting token without bricking the system). This test was a huge success; we can now work on the Documentation and the Token Abstraction Governance (Detailed info in the last weekly).
## Are you supporting buidl V1? 
Nope. The DFOhub team will longer support buidl V1 both technically or formally after August 1, 2020. Since the Switch, we haven’t provided any liquidity for it on Uniswap, and we kindly recommend that you switch your buidl V1 to buidl V2 ASAP (even if the prices are going crazy at the moment!).
## Are you killing the buidl V1? 
Nope. The buidl V1 Smart Contract will continue working as a regular ERC20, but it’s no longer connected to or usable by DFOhub’s DFO.
